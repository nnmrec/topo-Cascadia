[I] Installation (for a linux i686 computer with g77) :

# 1 Copy the gzip tar file roms_package.tar.gz from the CDROM 

# 2 uncompress it (gunzip) and untar it (tar -xvf)

# 3 log as root (su root)

# 4 cd ~/Roms_tools/ and install xanim and ppm2fli for animations
(rpm -ivh xanim-2.80.1-12.i386.rpm ; rpm -ivh ppm2fli-2.1-1.i386.rpm)

# 5 (exit)

# 6 cd ~/Roms_tools/Run

# 7 run ./jobcomp to test model compilation

[II] Model preparation

# 8 launch matlab in ~/Roms_tools/Run

# 9 run start in matlab (matlab paths)

# 10 edit ~/Roms_tools/Preprocessing_tools/make_grid.m

# 11 give the title, the grid file name, the r smoothing parameter
(r=max(|grad H|/H)), the grid positions (lonmin, lonmax, latmin, latmax),
the grid resolution (in degrees), and the minimum depth (hmin).  

# 12 run make_grid in matlab

# 13 edit ~/Roms_tools/Preprocessing_tools/make_forcing.m

# 14 give the title, the grid file name, and the forcing file name
 
# 15 run make_forcing in matlab

# 16 edit ~/Roms_tools/Preprocessing_tools/make_clim.m

# 17 give the title, the grid file name, the forcing file name,
the climatology file name, the initial file name, the objective analysis file name,
the vertical grid parameters (theta_s=6.,theta_b=0.,hc=10.,N=32), 
the switches for open boundaries, the level of reference for geostrophy,
and the day of initialisation.

# 18 run make_clim in matlab

# 19 edit ~/Roms_tools/Tides/make_tides.m

# 20 run make_tides in matlab

[III] Model compilation

# 21 edit ~/Roms_tools/Run/param.h

# 22 give the grid dimensions (Lm,Mm,N)

# 23 edit ~/Roms_tools/Run/cppdefs.h

# 24 activate the cpp keys corresponding to the different model options
(attention to the opne boundaries: should be conform to make_clim.m)

# 25 cd ~/Roms_tools/Run

# 26 run ./jobcomp for compilation

[IV] Model Run

# 27 edit ~/Roms_tools/Run/roms.in to give the mdel run parameters (dt,ndtfast,etc..)

# 28 run ./roms roms.in 

[V] Visualization

# 29 run roms_gui in matlab

[VI] Zooms

# 30 run nestgui in matlab

# 31 activate the cpp key AGRIF in cppdefs.h
